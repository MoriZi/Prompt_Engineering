    "# Understanding GPT Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers)**: A sophisticated Large Language Model (LLM) developed using deep learning techniques.\n",
    "  - Built upon a decoder-only transformer architecture.\n",
    "  - Primary goal:\n",
    "    - To analyze text data and produce outputs that closely mimic human language patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Components:\n",
    "  - Generative\n",
    "  - Pre-trained\n",
    "  - Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generative Aspect\n",
    "- Highlights the model's proficiency in creating text by analyzing and reacting to text inputs.\n",
    "- Prior to GPT:\n",
    "  - Methods primarily involved reordering or selecting words directly from the given inputs.\n",
    "  - GPT's generative abilities significantly surpass previous models by:\n",
    "    - Generating text that is both more coherent and resembles human writing more closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training Approach: **Autoregressive language modeling**,\n",
    "  - The model sequentially processes input words.\n",
    "    - It predicts the next word by calculating probability distributions, aiming to select the most likely subsequent word or phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-Trained Nature\n",
    "- Refers to models prepped on vast datasets before application to specific tasks.\n",
    "- For GPT:\n",
    "  - Trained on a broad collection of text, employing an unsupervised learning strategy.\n",
    "  - This pre-training phase enables the model to identify language patterns and relationships autonomously.\n",
    "- Post-training, GPT can apply its learned language understanding to tasks like answering questions or summarizing texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformers Architecture\n",
    "- A neural network design engineered for managing texts of various lengths.\n",
    "- Became well-known following the release of the \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper in 2017.\n",
    "- GPT's architecture:\n",
    "   - Is centered around the **decoder-only** model.\n",
    "   - Utilizes a \"self-attention mechanism\" that:\n",
    "      - Allows the model to understand the significance of each word in relation to others within the same sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider the sentences:\n",
    "  - \"A dog is sitting on the bank of the River Ganga.\"\n",
    "  - \"Iâ€™ll withdraw some money from the bank.\"\n",
    "- Through self-attention, the model evaluates words in context:\n",
    "  - In the first scenario, \"bank\" is linked to \"River,\" indicating a riverbank.\n",
    "  - In the second, \"bank\" in connection with \"money\" refers to a financial institution.\n"
