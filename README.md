# Course Overview

The Generative AI Prompt Engineering training course is designed to demonstrate the concepts of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), and provide students with hands-on experience in leveraging these technologies as a part of their software development lifecycle.

The course begins with an overview of working with LLMs and NLP with OpenAI. Students learn to craft and refine effective prompts to create solutions to specific software engineering scenarios. Next, students learn to implement NLP techniques into their own applications to build custom chatbots. The course concludes with best practices for developing applications with the support of generative AI.
