    "### Developing an AI-Powered Code Assistant Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "Create a versatile AI-powered code assistant tool that leverages advanced prompt engineering techniques learned throughout the course to aid in programming tasks across different languages. The project emphasizes not only the application of these techniques but also the systematic organization of prompts and outcomes for reusability and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Setup:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment Setup:**\n",
    "   - Set up the development environment to interact with OpenAI APIs, focusing on the GPT family of models.\n",
    "   - Ensure API keys and necessary software dependencies are properly configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initial API Integration:**\n",
    "   - Integrate the OpenAI API with a simple application scaffold, enabling basic querying capabilities.\n",
    "   - Implement functionality to dynamically insert prompts into API requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Engineering and Management:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt Documentation:**\n",
    "   - Create a centralized documentation repository or directory within your project for storing detailed information about each prompt, including its purpose, parameters used (e.g., temperature, max tokens), and any specific nuances or considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prompt Template Creation:**\n",
    "   - Develop a system of prompt templates that can be easily modified and reused. These templates should be designed to cover a range of tasks the code assistant might encounter, incorporating variables for dynamic content insertion.\n",
    "   - Store these templates in a version-controlled directory within your project's codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Version Control:**\n",
    "   - Utilize Git or another version control system to track changes to prompt templates and documentation over time. This approach allows for the rollback to previous versions if newer modifications reduce performance or accuracy.\n",
    "   - Include a versioning scheme for prompts that reflects the progression of your prompt engineering techniques and iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Configuration Management:**\n",
    "   - Embed prompts and API configurations as part of your application's configuration. This could involve configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML) that are read by your application at runtime.\n",
    "   - Consider environmental variables for sensitive or environment-specific configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applying Advanced Prompting Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Technique Application:**\n",
    "   - Sequentially introduce zero-shot, few-shot, CoT prompting, self-consistency, and other techniques into the project, starting with simpler tasks and gradually addressing more complex scenarios.\n",
    "   - For each technique, develop a set of prompts tailored to programming-related tasks, documenting the rationale, expected outcomes, and actual performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Outcome Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - Establish a method for evaluating the effectiveness of different prompting techniques and templates. This could involve manual testing, automated scripts, or a combination of both.\n",
    "   - Document outcomes, insights, and potential areas for improvement in your centralized documentation repository."
