    "\n",
    "2. **Building Your Prompt Portfolio:**\n",
    "   - Create a directory within your repository named `Prompt Portfolio`.\n",
    "   - For each prompt developed, include a file (markdown preferred) that describes:\n",
    "     - The purpose of the prompt.\n",
    "     - How it was designed and why.\n",
    "     - Example inputs and outputs.\n",
    "     - Potential modifications or alternate applications.\n",
    "   - This portfolio will serve as both a documentation of your learning process and a reference tool for future projects.\n",
